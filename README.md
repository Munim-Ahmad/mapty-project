# Mapty Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. I built this application to practice and enhance my JavaScript skills, utilizing modern techniques such as ES6+, map and filter methods, and event handling. The project was inspired by the 'The Complete JavaScript Course' by [Jonas Schmedtmann]. It allows users to track their workouts (running or cycling) on an interactive map.

## Features
- Add workout locations using your deviceâ€™s geolocation
- Store and display data about workouts, including type, distance, duration, and pace
- Visualize the workouts on an interactive map using Leaflet

## API Credit

This project uses the Leaflet API for rendering the interactive map and storing geolocation data.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank [Jonas Schmedtmann] for creating an insightful course that helped me understand JavaScript concepts deeply, and for providing guidance throughout this project.
